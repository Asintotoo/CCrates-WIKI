    <h3>Rarity and Opening Animations</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>rarity</strong> can be one of the following values:
        <strong>COMMON</strong>, <strong>UNCOMMON</strong>, <strong>RARE</strong>, <strong>EPIC</strong>, or <strong>LEGENDARY</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>opening</strong> animation can be one of the following:
        <strong>INSTANT</strong>, <strong>COUNTDOWN</strong>, <strong>CSGO</strong>, <strong>COSMIC</strong>, or <strong>SPIRAL</strong>.
        Each animation corresponds to a different opening style:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INSTANT</strong>: The crate opens immediately upon right-clicking.</li>
        <li><strong>COUNTDOWN</strong>: A countdown is displayed before the prize is given.</li>
        <li><strong>CSGO</strong>: The animation mimics the crate opening animation seen in CSGO.</li>
        <li><strong>COSMIC</strong>: The player is prompted to select a given amount of random slots in a gui, then an animation starts after which the prizes which ended up in those selected slots are given to the player.</li>
        <li><strong>SPIRAL</strong>: A GUI is opened where a slow spiral of prizes is composing, the prizes that ends up being in the final slot will be given to the player.</li>
    </ul>
	
	<h3>Editing rarities and openings</h3>
    <p>
        You can edit rarities' display names in the your selected messages file (default: <code>messages/en.yml</code>) and their chance modification in the <code>config.yml</code>.
    </p>
	<p>
        You can edit some openings settings in their specific yaml file located in the "openings" folder within the plugin directory.
    </p>

    <h3>ItemCreator Library</h3>
    <p>
        Each prize item is created using the <a href="https://github.com/Asintotoo/ItemCreator" target="_blank">ItemCreator library</a>,
        which allows for easy and customizable creation of items in your crates.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding Prizes via Command</h3>
    <p>
        You can also add prizes to crates via commands. For more details, visit the <a href="commands.html" target="_self">Commands</a> page.
